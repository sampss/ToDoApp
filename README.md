# 🗂️ ToDoApp – Modular Task Management for HomeManager Suite

ToDoApp is a standalone, plugin-ready task management module designed to operate independently or as part of the scalable **HomeManager** ecosystem. It supports multi-user profiles, cross-module integration, offline-first access, and optional ad monetization.

---

## 🚀 MVP Feature Set

The initial build includes essential task management functionality:
- ✅ Task creation, editing, deletion
- 🕒 Due dates, priority tags, and status tracking
- 🗂️ Filter and sort by tag, date, priority
- 💾 SQLite-backed local storage with offline access
- 🎨 Theming and accessibility (dark mode, font scaling)

---

## 🌱 Modular Enhancements (Optional Plugins)

Future-ready features can be added without affecting core logic:
- 🔁 Recurring task engine
- 🔗 Task dependencies and visual flow
- ⏳ Pomodoro timer plugin
- 🗣️ Voice input module
- 📆 Calendar view integration
- 🎯 Goal-setting and streak tracking
- 📊 Productivity analytics dashboard

---

## 👥 Multi-User Architecture

ToDoApp supports shared devices and centralized data per user:
- `user_id` scoped data in both local storage and remote DB
- Local caching supports device-default user and temporary guest profiles
- Planned sync logic for user-specific task syncing from cloud
- User switcher UI with identity context across modules

---

## 🔄 Integration with HomeManager Ecosystem

Designed for seamless communication with sibling modules:
- InventoryManager: Tasks can reference tracked items
- FinanceTracker: Scheduled payments trigger actionable tasks
- HomeMaintenanceLog: Completed tasks feed into logs or reports

Shared services across modules:
- Centralized theme engine
- Notification dispatcher
- User preferences handler
- Cross-module event hooks (e.g., `onTaskComplete`)

---

## 📱 Cross-Platform Strategy

ToDoApp is built with compatibility for mobile and web:
- Reusable UI components across React Native and React Web
- Service abstraction for storage (SQLite, async storage, local cache, cloud sync)

---

## 📢 Ad Monetization (Web & Mobile)

Optional support for non-intrusive advertisements:
- Google AdMob or AdSense integration via modular `AdModule`
- Responsive layouts with designated ad containers
- Conditional rendering based on network, user tier, and screen size
- Premium users can disable ads via settings or HomeManager tiering

Ad Placement Ideas:
- Home screen banner (dismissible)
- Footer of task list
- “Tips & Insights” pane on analytics page
