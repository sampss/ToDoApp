    "# Task Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Task` interface defines the data structure used throughout the app to represent a single to-do item. It's stored in `/shared/types/Task.ts` to ensure it's easily imported across modules like UI, database, and logic layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "### `id: number`\n",
    "A unique identifier for each task.\n",
    "- Source: SQLite AUTOINCREMENT or generated with `Date.now()` for in-memory tasks.\n",
    "- Purpose: Used as a key in lists and to update/delete specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### `title: string`\n",
    "The task description provided by the user.\n",
    "- Example: `\"Refactor AddTask component\"`\n",
    "- Used in: UI display (`TaskCard`), SQLite inserts, and validation.\n",

    "\n",
    "### `completed: boolean`\n",
    "Status flag indicating whether a task is done.\n",

    "\n",
    "### `createdAt: string`\n",
    "A timestamp of when the task was created, formatted as an ISO string.\n",

    "### `competeBy: string?`\n",
    "ISO timestamp string representing when the task is due. Optional - can be undefined\n",
    "- Enables sorting tasks by urgency\n",
    "- Lets you add visual indicators (e.g. overdue/red highlight)\n",
    "- Preps you for later modules like notification reminders or calendar syn\n",

    "\n",
    "This interface is used anywhere task objects are handled:\n",
    "- `TaskCard.tsx` (UI rendering)\n",
    "- `TaskListScreen.tsx` (state management and rendering list)\n",
    "- `TaskDB.ts` (SQLite storage and retrieval)\n",

    "## Why It Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "TypeScript interfaces like this one help:\n",
    "- Prevent bugs from inconsistent data shapes\n",
    "- Improve IDE autocompletion and refactoring\n",
    "- Make the app easier to scale and maintain"
