This module is ready to drop into your screen logic. Next up, we can:
- 🔗 Integrate openDB() into your app startup
- ⬇️ Load saved tasks on screen load
- ➕ Replace dummy state with addTask() for persistence
Want me to walk you through hooking this into TaskListScreen.tsx next? We’ll wire it to show your SQLite-backed list live.
